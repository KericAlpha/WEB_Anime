              <a>The loss of her own family led her to accept Eren and his family as her new one. The fear of losing this has become gigantic for her due to the incident in her childhood, so that she follows Eren every step of the way</a>

              <a>Always feeling like a burden, always having the feeling of standing in everyone's way, makes Armin think that he is absolutely useless. Whenever he is really needed, he is overwhelmed by his inner fear, which makes him unable to move. How should a boy, whose physical strength is almost nonexistent, also pursue a military profession without any problems?</a>

              <a> Humanity has been pushed to the edge of its existence so that it can no longer live outside its walls. Nor do most of them believe that the Titans could ever be ousted. Almost the only glimmer of hope can be described as Levi, who is called the strongest soldier of mankind. </a>

              <a>Erwin is therefore in a very difficult position. It is not only that he and his people are exposed to constant dangers, he also always has to present successes that justify the continued existence of his unit.</a>
