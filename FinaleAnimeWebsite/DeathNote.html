              <a> In Tokyo, an intelligent yet disaffected high-school student named Light Yagami finds the "Death Note", a mysterious black notebook which can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face. After verifying that the notebook works and initially being terrified of its god-like abilities, Light begins to consider the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and sets out to create a utopian world without crime, killing numerous high-profile Japanese criminals, before eventually targeting international criminals and felons around the world. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a "Shinigami", beings inspired by the Japanese god of death and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, who is invisible to anyone who has not touched the Death Note, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions.</a>

              <a>L is clearly a somewhat strange and mysterious young man and also Kira's opponent. He's definitely a great genius and he always knows what to do, his methods being like a game where he's outright throwing the next move up his sleeve. He is therefore a very well-known private detective about whom nothing is known because he does not reveal his identity or appearance.
