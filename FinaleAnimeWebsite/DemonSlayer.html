The demons are former humans who sold their humanity in exchange for power, they feed on humans and possess super natural abilities such as super strength, magic and regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they're decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known as Sun Steel, injected with poison extracted from wisteria flowers, or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are entirely human, however, they employ special breathing technique, known as total concentration breathing, which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance.</a>

            <a>The daughter of a charcoal-seller and Tanjiro's younger sister, Nezuko Kamado is the cute but strong demon female protagonist. Despite Muzan's assumption that he killed them all in his attempt to sire a sun-resistant demon, Nezuko survived as a demon with her mind mostly gone. However, she retained enough of her memories to keep herself from killing Tanjiro. Due to two years of hypnotic conditioning by Urokodaki, Nezuko regards all humans as her family and will mercilessly attack any demon that threatens them.</a>
