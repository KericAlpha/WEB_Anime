              <a> Rei is completely different from all other children her age: Her facial expression hardly changes, she shows practically no feelings when it comes to her life or that of other people, and she is the first of Marduk selected pilots of the Evangelion project. The strange loner is surrounded by a tangle of secrets: Why is she more important to Gendo Ikari than his own son? </a>

              <a>Asuka Langley Soryu is the second child and the pilot of EVA-02. She was selected for this task shortly before its completion and then sent to Japan. Due to her Japanese coordination, the native German did not find this change difficult, especially since she is fluent in both German and Japanese. </a>
