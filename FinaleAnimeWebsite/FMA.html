              <h2>General:</h2>
              <a>The Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood series is a more detailed reissue of the story of the Elric brothers. This is based on the manga. So it is not a continuation.
                Full metal chemist brotherhood
                The new series "Brotherhood"
                
                It is a new anime story with the same basic idea, but which is more profound and well thought out than the 2003 version.</a>

              <h2>Plot:</h2>
              <a>Edward and Alphonse Elric are two brothers from the land of Amestria who had the goal of bringing their mother back to the living, which is why they learned alchemy. But their attempt to perform the human transmutation failed and the proportions were great: Edward lost his left leg and brother. He sacrificed his right arm to be able to get back at least the soul of his younger brother and tied it to armor. They gave up their goal of seeing their mother's smile all over again.
