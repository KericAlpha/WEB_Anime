              <h2>Plot:</h2>
              <a>Most of the people in the world are born with super powers. Everyone receives a different power and the powers are used for good and bad, so that there is constant fighting between superheroes and super villains. The heroes, whose skills are called “quirks” (個性, kosei, in the anime in German: “specialties”), are trained in special schools. Middle school student Izuku Midoriya (緑谷 出 久) would also like to become a superhero, but he belongs to the 20% of people without such skills. When he protects another child from a villain, he meets the most famous of all superheroes: All Might. This gives him his strength (by taking one of his hairs), which gets stronger the more you get. She gives Izuku great physical strength. However, he can hardly control them at first. But he can now follow his dream and go to Helden-Oberschule U.A. Go to high school (雄 英 高校, Yūei Kōkō). This is where his competitor Katsuki, his girlfriend Ochako and the class representative Tenya appear. The son of the hero Endeavor, Shōto, only uses his ice attacks (he also has fire attacks), but becomes another competitor of Izuku. After Izuku lost his fight against Shōto, he is taught by Gran Torino, who is the master of All Might. But Tenya's brother is badly wounded in a fight with Stain, the murderer of the hero, and Izuku and Shōto rush to the aid of their friend. Together they succeed in defeating Stain, but the feat is, for the public, ascribed to Endeavor
