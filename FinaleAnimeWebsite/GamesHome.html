              <h2>Anime Games:</h2>
              <a >Anime and Games are two things that cant be seperated there are many Anime where the plot is based around a game like in The rising of a Shield Hero or sometimes the main character is a gamer like in No Game No Life but thatâ€™s not the only connection there are plenty anime games and Novels around who are based of an already existing Anime or are just in the art style and storytelling like an Anime of course there are also Anime that where based on a game then there is an Japan original type which are Gatcha games.</a>

              <h2>What is a Visual Novel:</h2>

              <a>Japanese visual novels are characteristically very static with a 2D anime look with recurring backgrounds and accompanied by situation music. You hardly ever see animations and it usually takes a long time to play them through. However, there are now a number of games in which almost the entire game is animated. Titles published after 2012 are especially full of animations. One of the most famous games also available on Steam is Nekopara.</a>

                <a> Gacha games are video games that implement the gacha (capsule-toy vending machine) mechanic. This is somewhat similar to loot boxes, inducing players to spend in-game currency to receive a random virtual item. Most of these games are free-to-play mobile games, where the gacha serves as an incentive to spend real-world money like in japanese slot machines which are very common in japan. A very popular one is Epic Seven </a>
