              <h2>Plot:</h2>
              <a> At the end of the Edo period in the 19th century, aliens, the Amanto, took power in Japan and banned the wearing of swords. This is how the samurai fell. But Gintoki Sakata (坂 田 銀 時) still feels committed to the ideals of the samurai and wears a (wooden) sword. Because he cannot or does not want to continue his old life, he begins a new life as the “jack of all trades”, whereby he accepts almost all orders for money.
                Shinpachi Shimura (志 村 新 八), a waiter whom Gintoki saves from Amanto, joins him on his travels. The voracious Kagura (神 楽), which is pursued by the Yakuza and comes from another planet, will soon join him. </a>
