              <p></p>
              <h2>Plot:</h2>
              <a> The series takes place in a fictional world based on our times, in which the secret, royal Protestant Hellsing order of knights on behalf of the British Crown in Great Britain has successfully fought vampires and other undead for centuries. But for some time now there have been not only natives, real vampires, but also freaks, artificially created with the help of an implanted computer chip. Worried about their rapid growth, the organization sends the vampire Alucard to help eliminate the freaks. Seras, a survivor of a massacre and made a vampire by Alucard out of necessity, now serves as his adjutant. </a>

              <a> Alucard (Ananym for Dracula) is a real vampire with great power who works for the Hellsing organization. Twenty years ago, Lady Integra's father banished him to the dungeon of the Hellsing estate and affixed seals that he must first lift in order to use his power. He was freed from Integra after she took refuge in the basement from her uncle, who wanted to usurp the inheritance after Arthur Hellsing's death and kill the child. Alucard has served her ever since. Alucard is a very proud vampire who treats his opponents more or less sadistically. </a>

              <a>Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, referred to in the manga as her father Sir Hellsing, is the head of the Hellsing organization. She is the youngest and only female member of the so-called Roundtable, a council in which all secret and non-secret organizations of the British government coordinate their joint action in the fight against vampires, among other things. She inherited her post as head of the Knightly Order from her father Arthur Hellsing, who died when she was 13 years old.

              <a> Seras was originally a police officer and was fatally wounded by Alucard while working against freaks when one of the vampires used her as a protective shield. Alucard offered to make her a vampire to save her. Since then she has been working with Alucard for the Hellsing organization but is nowhere near his skills. In addition, she refuses to drink human blood for a long time, even though the organization has donated blood to her. As a vampire, Seras has enormous physical strength and often uses heavy weapons. </a>
