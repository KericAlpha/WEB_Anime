              <h2>Plot Part 2 Battle Tendency:</h2>
              <a> Battle Tendency, takes place in 1939. Jonathan's grandson Joseph teams up with Will's grandson Caesar Zeppeli to battle ancient humanoids called the Pillar Men,[8] but are overwhelmed by the Pillar Man Wamuu. Joseph and Caesar have a month to defeat the Pillar Men Esidisi and Wamuu to obtain the antidotes for the poisoned rings in Joseph's windpipe and aorta,[9] while also preventing them from gaining a powerful stone called the Super Aja.[10] The two are trained in controlling Hamon by the Hamon coach Lisa Lisa.[11] Joseph defeats Esidisi and Wamuu,[12] but Kars obtains the Super Aja, becoming more powerful.[13] Aided by the German soldier Rudol von Stroheim, Joseph uses the Super Aja against Kars to defeat him.[14][15] In the epilogue set in the 1980s, a "treasure chest" engraved with the name "DIO" is salvaged from the sea, while an older Joseph is set to meet his daughter in Japan.</a>
