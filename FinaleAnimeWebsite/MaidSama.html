              <h2>Plot:</h2>
              <a>The Seika High School was once a boys-only school, but over time it opened up to girls too. The isolation created a harsh climate in the classes, so that the girls find it very difficult to gain a foothold and repeatedly suffer from the humiliation of the boys. The girl Misaki Ayuzawa (鮎 沢 美 咲) nevertheless manages to assert herself against her classmates and to become the first student representative. Because of her behavior, she is soon seen as a man hater, but is respected or feared. But behind this facade she also fights against various other problems. Among other things, her family, which consists of her mother and little sister, was abandoned by her father and is now sitting on a large pile of debt. To put a stop to the collapse of her own apartment and to help her overworked mother, Misaki looks for a job in a maid café. Since she mainly has to serve male customers there, she tries to keep her job a secret from her classmates.

              <a>Misaki Ayuzawa is one of the few students at Seika High School and the board of the student council there, where she is the only female member. Recently, Seika High School was still an all-boys school, so the reputation of the school has suffered a lot, so that looking students did not want to attend this school at first. But with Misa-chan's appointment as student president, the school's reputation changes suddenly, so that the current proportion of female students is at least 20%.

              <a>Takumi Usui is one of Misaki Ayuzawa's classmates at Seika High School and her male counterpart, so to speak. Takumi is incredibly popular. Both the male and the small proportion of female classmates downright adore him. For the boys he is something of a role model, an ideal of a successful and strong leader. For women he is simply the perfect friend. There is hardly a girl at school who is not in love with Takumi
