                <a> Bleach (original spelling: BLEACH ブ リ ー チ, Burīchi; Eng. "Bleach") is a manga series by the Japanese illustrator Tite Kubo, which was also implemented as an anime. In the world of bleach there are other parallel dimensions besides the world of humans. In one of these live the Shinigami (dt. "Death Gods"), which are organized as a military-run training center. The world itself is called the Soul Society (尸 魂 界 ソ ウ ル ・ ソ サ エ テ ィ, Sōru Sosaeti, dt. "Corpse Soul World"), in the center of which is the Seireitei (瀞 霊 廷), the training center. There, the young recruits are trained to be Shinigami, who are supposed to keep the Hollows (虚 ホ ロ ウ, Horō, dt. "Emptiness") from robbing people of their souls. At the same time, they should bring the souls of the deceased to the Soul Society, where they will continue their lives outside the gates of the Seiretei.</a>
