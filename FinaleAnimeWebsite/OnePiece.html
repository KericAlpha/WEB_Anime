              <h2>General:</h2>

It has been published weekly in Shūkan Shōnen Jump since 1997. The individual chapters are also bundled in collective editions published by Shūeisha, which broke multiple records for publication, including the largest opening edition of a book in Japan and the first book, which has sold over three million copies. With more than 460 million copies shipped worldwide as of December 2019, including around 390 million in Japan alone, it is the best-selling manga series in history.

              <h2>Plot:</h2>
              <a>In a fictional world, the Straw Hat Gang, a group of pirates led by Monkey D. Luffy, is looking for the legendary treasure One Piece of the pirate king Gol D. Roger alias Gold Roger. In addition, the background stories of individual characters are examined in more detail in flashbacks.
                The series is divided into large arcs, which usually end with a fight against a powerful opponent. However, Luffy and his crew do not kill their opponents: Eiichirō Oda justifies this with the fact that the defeated opponents suffer the end of their dreams and convictions anyway through their defeat. Some former opponents return later in the story with often positive motives, sometimes there is then a temporary collaboration due to common interests.
                
                Additional subplots result from cover stories that show further experiences of opponents who have already been defeated or friends and comrades-in-arms who have been left behind and which sometimes introduce new characters. The respective storyline can also lead back to the main story at a later point in time. One example is the buggy cover story, so called by fans: After the pirate buggy was defeated by Luffy, he experiences a little odyssey away from the main events and later returns to take revenge on Luffy.</a>

              <a>Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・D・ルフィ, Monkī Dī Rufi) is the primary protagonist of the One Piece series. At age seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gives his body the properties of rubber. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril causing Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him. After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving instead to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates.</a>
