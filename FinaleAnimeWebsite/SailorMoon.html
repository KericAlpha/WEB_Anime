              <h2>General:</h2>
              <a>Sailor Moon (Japanese 美 少女 戦 士 セ ー ラ ー ム ー ン, Bishōjo Senshi Sērā Mūn; in German Beautiful Girl Warrior Sailor Moon, formerly the official international title “Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon”, now “Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon”) is a series of manga by the Japanese illustrator Naoko Takei. In addition to the best-known adaptation of the work as an anime series and the remake Sailor Moon Crystal from 2014, it was also implemented in the form of movies, games and musicals.

              <h2>Plot:</h2>
              <a>The clumsy girl Usagi Tsukino (in the first translation and in the anime Bunny Tsukino) meets the talking cat Luna one day, who reveals to the girl her fate as Sailor Moon, warrior for love and justice. Bunny has to find the moon princess as there is a mysterious force that threatens the earth and the moon. Only the moon princess is able to defeat these evil forces and banish them from the galaxy forever. She uses the silver crystal, probably the most powerful weapon in the universe, which takes the life of those who unfold their full power. Little by little she meets the sailor warriors Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Venus, who stand by her side in the fight against evil with their own special attacks, but above all with their friendship and love.

              <a>Usagi lives a carefree life, with a great potential for love, with the ability to transform into the heroine Sailor Moon. At first, however, she is a very scared crybaby, and you can tell that she hates fighting evil. Over time, however, she learns to take responsibility with her skills.

              <a>Usagi's first encounter with the black cat Luna is very unfortunate, because Usagi accidentally steps on her at full speed and lies down lengthways. In the following, however, the cat seems to follow her somehow and eventually even shows up at her home,

              <a> Ami has an IQ of 300 and is therefore by far the smartest person at Usagi's school, but prefers to stay alone and not make contact with other students, which is due to her shy personality. Because of her reputation as an infallible genius, she is also wrongly considered to be aloof or even unfriendly, and so there is hardly anyone who tries to contact her on his own initiative. Usagi </a> is an exception

              <a>At the beginning, Mamoru runs into Usagi by chance, either running against him without looking or hitting him with a crumpled piece of paper that she thrown carelessly over her shoulder. He uses these opportunities to tease her about her hairstyle. </a>

              <a>Shrine priestess Rei has had supernatural powers since early childhood, which is why she was often avoided or even attacked by others. People tend to blame them for all sorts of inexplicable things because of their mysterious powers. </a>

              <a>Makoto arrives at Usagi's school as a new exchange student, but before they meet there, they already run into each other on the street when Makoto prevents Usagi from being run over because she was daydreaming again instead of paying attention to her surroundings . Rumors about Makoto immediately grew up around the new school: Allegedly, she is said to be superhumanly strong and to have been kicked out of her old school for beating. </a>
