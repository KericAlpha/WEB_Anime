              <a> Yugi Muto (武 藤 遊戯, Mutō Yūgi) / Yugi Muto is a 16-year-old teenager and student who is small for his age and is therefore very often bullied by his classmates and peers. He is always friendly and helpful and can connect with Yami Yugi through the Millennium Puzzle. Through his friendship with the Pharaoh, he became more and more courageous and mature. </a>

              <a> Seto Kaiba is the owner of a large game company, Kaiba Corporation, and one of Yugi's rivals. His younger brother Mokuba always stands by him.

Their parents' property, which they were supposed to inherit, was illegally stolen from them by their relatives. They were adopted as orphans by Gozaburo Kaiba, the world's best chess player, because he was beaten by Seto in a game of chess. Since then, Seto Kaiba has also had the title of "World Chess Champion" </a>
