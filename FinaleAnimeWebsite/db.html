              <h2>Plot:</h2>
              <a> Four years after Son Goku and his friends defeated Boo, 778 by the Dragon Ball era, Beerus, the god of destruction, awakens from decades of sleep. In his dreams he had a vision of a super Saiyan god who should be an equal opponent. Once there was a super Saiyan god by the name of Yamoshi who wanted to fight the evil Saiyajin. However, it failed. Together with his teacher Whis he goes in search of this super Saiyan god and finally tracks down the last remaining Saiyans Vegeta and Son Goku. He happened to end up at Bulma's birthday party. </a>

                <a> Son Goku is born as the second son of Bardock and the younger brother of Raditz. He belongs to the Saiyajin people, is given the name Kakarott and is sent to earth by them as a baby to exterminate the people so that the Saiyajin can sell the planet. Son Goku never carries out his assignment, however, as Son Gohan found him shortly after landing, who adopted him and took him in. [1] [2]

              <a> Vegeta is a Saiyan like Son Goku. As the son of King Vegeta, he is her prince. He has served Freezer since he destroyed the planet Vegeta and its inhabitants. Raditz and Nappa are his followers. They raid planets (in Freezer's name), wipe out the population and auction him off to the highest bidder. He does this because he knows that he is still too weak to defeat Freezer. So he is waiting to punish him one day for making the "prince of the Saiyajins" (as he often points out) a slave. </a>
