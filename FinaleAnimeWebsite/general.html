        <h2>What does "Anime" mean?</h2>
        <a>In Japanese "anime" can refer to any animation film, both from their own country and from abroad. Outside of Japan, we use it for animated films from Japan. Before it got any famous, it was called senga ("line art") and kuga ("folding pictures"), dekobo shin gacho ("mischievous new images") or chamebo-zu ("playful pictures"). Later on the words manga eiga ("manga-movies") and doga ("movable pictures") got used. In the 1970s the word anime appears in Japan together with the word creation Japanimation. Anime originated as a shortening for the Japanese lain word animeshon ("animation"). At the end of the 1970s in the english speaking area, the word japanimation got used, and later on, in the 1990s, the word anime got used, because japanimation lead to misunderstandings. </a>
